# MyFirst
Those are my first steps with C++ language, created on Microsoft Visual Studio 19, guided by the book: "C++ Primer Plus" Sixth Edition by Stephen Prata (Polish version) 
I know that it's based on C++ 11 standard (pretty much) and "few" things are added at C++ 14 and C++ 17, but still it can be a good start with programing.

I'll try to add here all tasks from the book, and maybe in future something more.
